<h2 align='center'>Smart Farming Solution And Traceability Of Supplychain Using Blockchain</h2>
<p align='center'>Completely decentralised traceability system for the management of the agri-food supply chain. This is a blockchain network where all the stakeholders have transaction record of all the transactions. Blockchain provides certification and regulations for good quality food i.e avoid frauds.</p>

## Introduction
Improvements in farm productivity, improved use of agricultural inputs, appropriate marketing facilities and assistance, as well as effective food management, are all necessary for agriculture growth. Food safety appears to be a significant topic that both makers and customers are interested in. By providing transparency to supply chains, this aids in enhancing the manufacturing processes. It is crucial to be able to trace the origin of a food item so that it can have information about the producer and when it was made.

To address the intricate issues facing agriculture, cutting-edge technologies are being created.

Blockchain is one of those inventions that is still in its infancy. Its foundation is an encryption algorithm. It is an encrypted, decentralized database system for keeping track of deals. This makes sure that neither the transactions nor the identification of the user can ever be compromised. If a fake transaction takes place, the decentralized mining system will prevent it from being added to the hidden chain.

Blockchain technology can be used to keep a number of agricultural insurance programs, including the Nationwide Agro Security Scheme, secure with tamper-proof documents and for routinely verifying the settling of claims during harvest losses. The primary benefit of the blockchain system is that it eliminates the requirement for third-party agents because deals can be settled using smart contracts.
